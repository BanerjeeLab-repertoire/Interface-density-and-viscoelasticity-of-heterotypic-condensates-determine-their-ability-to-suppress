# Instructions for use
Videos acquired with known acquisition parameters (number of frames and exposure time) can be processed to get the particle trajectory data using Fiji. The custom Python codes provided here can be used on trajectory data with the input file format .xml to compute the particle MSDs and the complex moduli from the estimated MSDs.
